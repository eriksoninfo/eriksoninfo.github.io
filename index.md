### About
Oceanum is a (hopefully)long-term project written by Nathan Haas. Oceanum is a modern story set in a modern society that actively strives to avoid conflict. Heavy inspiration was taken from Wildbow's 'Worm' as well as Brandon Sanderson's talks on magic systems. A schedule has yet to have been definitively decided, but once the story is up and running, chapters should be out once a week on Fridays. I'm bad with timing. Definitely a work in progress, as I am trying out various ideas as I go. Thanks for reading, and feel free to contact me at forsigningup.my.dude@gmail.com
