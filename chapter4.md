### Chapter 4

Amber readjusted her stance next to Eve. Being practically born into the rebels had its perks, though menial tasks such as this were certainly not included. When Amber had first been assigned here, Eve had been smug about it. That smugness was noticed by officials which promptly landed her there as well. Supposedly, Eve was sent as ‘offensive support’, but that was purely to help her ego. There was nothing to ‘offend’ against here. They were tasked with watching over a local recruitment center through the next week’s end. The elderly man that worked there seemed a tad bit senile, but he apparently knew quite a bit about relics and seeing the potential of someone’s future. Likewise, Amber was sent due to her ability to gather information in a unique fashion.

Those were long days standing next to Eve. Eve found ways to provoke her that would go unnoticed by Dr. Leopold. Though, it wasn’t so hard to do things behind his back with how engrossed he became in Solitaire as soon as the cards were laid out. She would send small sparks through her fingertips into Amber’s back. Amber knew her relic allowed her to take her frustration out without consequences, even if it would be a waste of Flow. This wouldn’t stop fantasizing about it.

Two days in and only four visitors as of yet. Four times she’s had to run an impromptu background check, which they all passed. Two were raised in Pariah land, one in the untouched zone, and the last had been moving all their life. All willing to risk their lives to bring down the Reliquary. Background checks were so exceptionally unnecessary here. Many times before, Amber had thought about convincing the higher ups to give her *something* to do that had *some* meaning. She had always backed down when she thought how difficult it would be to actually explain her power. Even she barely understood it and she’d been tinkering with it for years.

It was around 19:00 on a Saturday when the 5th visitor arrived. It was a tad late, but the Pariahs ran on a different schedule anyway. One foot through the door was all the signal necessary for Amber to get to work. She reached into the pocket of her khaki pants and grabbed out a stopwatch. Once it started, she’d have roughly 3 minutes to get what she needed if she wanted to conserve Flow. Time to begin.

*Click*

She charged the boy, knocking him to the ground. On the way down his left arm banged against the doorway. Now she would definitely have to listen to the time limit to keep him safe. He yelled out in pain. She rolled him over and wrenched his injured arm behind his back, pushing down. Eve and Dr. Leopold stood by.

*Tick*

Thirty seconds had passed. Amber brought her hand to her hip, making sure her relic was still there. Sure enough, the pocket sized book hung on a thin silver chain wrapped around her belt. Back to work.

“Your name?”

The boy groaned. Sweat was already visibly accumulating on the side of his face, dripping towards his wavy blonde hair.

She twisted his arm back more. “I’ll ask again. Your name?” 

“The-Theo Hargreaves!”

*Tock*

She could swear she had heard the name Hargreaves somewhere before. “Why are you here?”

“Obviously to work with the rebels!”

Amber planted her knee on Theo’s upper back, pushing down. “Why are you *really* here?”

Theo gasped to breathe, smacking the ground with the full of his right arm. Colloquially, that generally meant surrender. It always seemed to weigh on Amber when she ended up actually hurting people in this state. She relaxed her stance over him, letting him take in a breath of air.

*Tick*

“Listen, I just want to know something about this relic I have and I thought you would know,” Theo said, a bit of drool rolling down from his mouth. 

Normally that lack of commitment would be immediate cause to send him away, but seeing as she still had a bit of time on the clock, she could ask more.

*Tock*

“Where did you come from? I know you’re not from Pariah Territory.”

“I live over near the Reliquary,” he declared, “I promise you that, I think I have some ID in my bag to prove it.”

*Tick*

Time was running out. She had time for one more question. She thought for a moment, not sure what to land on. “What’s your father’s name?”

Amber could see him squint his eyes in confusion, but he answered nonetheless. “Joel.” 

If anything, she knew why the name was familiar. She couldn’t comprehend why the son of a Reliquary executive would leave their precious little bubble to come here, but that was irrelevant.

Time was up. Touching the tome at her side, she felt her vision expand across another dimension. Almost as if she were flicking through a powerpoint, she could see snapshots of moments of the recent past. Further back images were more faded and harder to latch onto. She found the moment just before the stopwatch was clicked and latched on. The world shifted around her as she watched the previous 3 minutes pass in reverse through the eyes of her own body. Her knee was lifted off of Theo’s back, they were back on their feet again. She ran backwards next to Eve, and Theo was back outside of the doorway again. Time resumed as it should. No one would remember any of this besides Amber. 

Theo walked inside with a rigid body. He paused for a moment taking in everything in the room, and cleared his throat. “Excuse me sir,” he said, facing Dr. Leopold. Amber rolled her eyes. The nerve that boy must have to come in here acting all polite. The rebels would earn brownie points with the Retainers if they were the ones to call Theo in. Amber went to the table and snatched up her phone. As she left the room towards the kitchen she could hear Theo and Dr. Leopold discussing particulars that she paid no mind to.

For being a shabby place, the kitchen was at least nice enough. She used the island to support her body weight as she began typing in the Retainer contact info. Eve sulked around to the other side of the kitchen and opened her mouth to speak. “You should be in there watching Harvey.”

“It’s Dr. Leopold, and shouldn’t your ‘offensive support’ be enough, Eve?” As much as Amber would love to have riled up Eve in that moment, using so much Flow had drained her of any energy. She was exhausted. “Actually, can you do me a favor and call this guy into the Retainers?”

Lines etched themselves into Eve’s forehead as her voice lowered, “Did you do your whole ‘no consequences’ shtick?” The way she said ‘no consequences’ mirrored the way Amber had talked about her offensive support.

“Turns out the kid is the son of one Mr. Joel Hargreaves.”

Eve chuckled quietly, “Of course he is. Even the way he walked in here reeked of them.”

“Anyway,” Amber muttered, sliding her phone over to Eve, “I need to go rest. Please call them before he leaves.”

Eve nodded and picked up the phone. Leaving the kitchen was a small room, no bigger than a closet, with three stacked beds inside. Each bed was made neat and orderly, courtesy of Dr. Leopold. It amazed her that the man could act so brazen and eccentric yet take the time every morning to tidy up. She climbed up to the upper bunk and collapsed on the bed. It would take only a few hours for her Flow to recharge, but she might as well sleep through the night to prepare for another day like this one.
