### Chapter 2

He made eye contact with himself in the mirror. Same Theo as he always had been. The same wavy blonde hair, the same ears that stuck out just a little bit further than they should have. He stood the same way as he always had, upright and confident, with his hands tucked into the pockets of his bomber jacket. He smiled, picking out some food from between his teeth where it had always gotten stuck before. The bright red shirt he wore underneath the jacket was baggy, making up for the length of his torso being well above average for his height. Most definitely the same Theo Hargreaves. 

He still doubted it. The real Theo Hargreaves wouldn't even think of venturing into Pariah territory, let alone want to go because of some die he stole. And yet this Theo Hargreaves did. It had been a little less than a week since he and Felix had gone to the Reliquary together, and it seemed that they were dealing with the outcome in very different ways. Felix was exasperatingly ecstatic that he was accepted to work with the Reliquary. He hadn't been assigned a position yet, but Theo couldn't be around him without the topic coming up repeatedly. Felix was insufferable. It was just so rare for Theo to be turned down for really anything. Deep down he knew some of that had to do with his class, but he was nevertheless proud of what he had done and was never afraid to flaunt it. It's called being confident, not egotistical. 

Perhaps one of the Pariah would know what was wrong with the die, or at least teach Theo what the hell to do with it. And once it was working, he could return to the Reliquary and rise up the ranks. Felix started the next Tuesday, which gave Theo the weekend and two days of the week if he was willing to skip out on school.

The doorbell rang. Theo sprang up from his desk, leaving the mirror behind. It was probably time for him to get up and get ready to go anyway. He had wasted the morning away thinking about what he wanted to do, and he knew he would pay for it later.

'Vacant' was the best word anyone could use to describe the house. With very little decoration, color, and a whole lot of openness, the only thing to fill the space was silence. It was very peaceful at times, but on the other hand it was eerily reminiscent of homes right before they're bought. Just clean enough that they could be toured at any moment, and just enough personality to pass as a home instead of a house.

He had to lean down to take a glance through the peephole, but it was worth it to make sure Felix wasn't at the door to continue bothering him. Making out the figure of a woman through the peephole, he decided it was safe to open up the door. As soon as Theo has cracked it open, the woman burst through the door, blurring past Theo.

"Didn't expect you to be home so early, Mom."

"No, I told you that I-" she stopped to catch her breath for a moment and turned back towards Theo. "Nevermind, sorry, I couldn't have told you, I was just stopping by to grab something and heading back out again."

He started heading back up the stairs to his room. Still had to pack everything up. He was only able to make about halfway up the stairs before his mom called his name again. Could she not just respect the fact that he was busy at the moment? He begrudgingly made his way back downstairs, finding her in the kitchen. "What do you need now?"

She was rapidly opening and closing cupboards and drawers before landing at the spice drawer. "Um, have you seen Joel at all?"

"Oh yeah, he was just by."

She grinned from ear to ear.

"I was joking Mom, of course Dad wasn't here. What do you even expect from him at this point? He's never home." Theo shook his head, filled with an almost paternal disappointment.

His mom slammed the spice cabinet closed and went back to opening and closing drawers, 'ignoring' what her son had said. "Well, at least help out Julie this weekend," she said, trying and failing to hide what effect Theo's statement had on her. "She has exams coming up."

"Sure thing Mom."

It was Theo's hypothesis that his parents had Julie a few years after Theo to make up for how he turned out. Julie was an eerily similar name to Joel as well. Arrogant bastard probably would've named his baby girl Joel if Mom wasn't there to restrain him. At the very least, Theo benefitted from how little they were in the house this weekend. Wouldn't even know he was gone, and if they did, they likely wouldn't care.

Anyway, he was on a time limit. Before making his way upstairs again, he grabbed a steak knife from the kitchen. It took until he was already upstairs that he realized it would be somewhat difficult to place a knife in his backpack without harming anything else in said backpack. He decided it couldn't hurt to try, and gently placed the knife down flat on the bottom of the bag. In the bag went two apples, a box of granola bars, a change of clothes, his wallet, and upon further thought, another knife.

Theo didn't know much about Pariah territory, but it didn't take a genius to know that what he normally wore would stand out. He snatched a black t-shirt and dark jeans out of his closet and began to rough them up. For some added authenticity, he took one of the knives from his bag and made cuts in both the jeans and shirt. He didn't have time to figure out a better outfit, so this would have to make do. He took one last look at himself holding the die in the mirror before shoving it into his jeans. Nothing left he could do to prepare.

*They might appreciate me leaving a note behind to tell them I'm leaving,* he thought, his hand already on the doorknob. He chuckled to himself before opening the door and taking his first steps outside. There was payoff in waiting to say anything. In just a few days, he could surprise Joel with the news as his coworker at the Reliquary instead of just his son.
