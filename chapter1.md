### Chapter 1

"You think they accept middle school keychains as a valid photo ID?"

Theo looked up with a smile on his face, only to see that Felix' expression was stone cold. The smile vanished as Theo suddenly remembered who he was talking to. "I'm sorry, but you dragged us all the way here and couldn't be bothered to prepare at least a little?"

Felix scoffed, "Of course I prepared! In this case, preparing just happened to mean grabbing the first photo of myself I saw on the way out the door. Don't worry about it man, I'll figure it out."

Theo sighed and leaned back in his chair. They'd been in this waiting room for a half hour at most, but it felt like so much longer than that. The room they sat in now was much cleaner than he thought it should be, at least considering the crowd it had attracted. White tiled flooring, white walls, white ceiling. He didn't understand the fascination with white things being cleaner than other colors, but that was beside the point. Felix had wanted to apply at the Reliquary for years, and when the time finally came, he dragged Theo along with him. He was convinced that it was just one of those things Felix had become fascinated with when he was younger and latched on to for no real reason. At least then he was interested in things he knew he couldn't do, like being an astronaut or getting a full ride to a private school.

Out of the corner of his eye, Theo noticed a younger gentleman enter from the far end of the room, readjust his tie, and take a moment to sigh. 

"Is there a Felix Kelly here?" he said, more quietly than he should have considering the packed room they were in. "Anyone?"

"One second sir!" Felix called out, waving back to the man. The man did not wave back. "Are you gonna be alright out here Theo?"

"I'm sure I'll manage. Shouldn't be too hard---I, at least, have my ID on me."

Felix scrunched up his face, "I guess we're gonna be nasty now. But seriously man, thank you for coming with me. It means a lot." 

As Felix followed the gentleman down the hallway, Theo saw him whip out his keychain and flash a grin. The man shook his head, but kept walking nonetheless. If all went well here, they'd likely be recruited by the Reliquary. It wasn't necessarily what Theo wanted, but he figured it was the safest way to go about pushing back the Pariah. It was only a few minutes before another older woman in a suit walked out of the hallway, paused, and called out Theo's name. The woman was short, stocky, and the pure embodiment of the word 'jolly'. Even the buttons on her bright grey suit looked as if they were about to pop from glee. Her smile was nearly glistening, but Theo did not find it contagious whatsoever. 

"Would you follow me please?" she asked, her voice ringing through the air like church bells. 

Theo groaned, "Of course." He stood from his chair, grabbing his jacket on the way. As they walked down the hallway, they passed numerous metal doors on either side. He noted how this contributed to the cleanliness aesthetic he had noticed earlier.

"Once we get to our testing room, you'll be asked a few questions. Just so you know in advance, we'll be separated by a glass screen," she said, her face suddenly growing dour, "It's safety protocol." Within a moment she had perked right back up again.

"Would you mind if we started that question process now?"
"Are you in a hurry? We only accept people that are truly dedicated to helping and supporting the Reliquary."

Theo chose to ignore this. One more hallway and two flights of stairs led them to the designated testing room. Opening the door revealed two paths that they could take, one with stairs leading to an upper level. The woman directed Theo to go to the left, where she would instead advance up the steps to the right. The room he entered was white, with a metal chair screwed to the ground in the center. Of course it was. At the top of the wall the chair faced was an observatory space with a large clear screen taking up nearly half the wall. Behind it stood the woman who walked him to the room, pacing back and forth. Towards the bottom of the wall was a small opening that looked similar to a mail slot.

The woman's voice sounded over an intercom, "Alright, let's start off with the questions. Name?"

"Theo Hargreaves."

"Age?"

"17."

"Address?"

"773 Pearbush Avenue." 
She paused for a moment, perhaps to think. "And what district would that be in?" 
The district where you lived mattered more in Erikson than it probably should have, but the variety of districts lead to easy stereotypes. Theo's district was generally considered to be in the upper end of class, having a history of breeding educated, well read, people. If they weren't educated or well read, they were rich, which was a fine enough substitution. Just southwest of there was Pariah territory. He had heard it described as being like the Wild West, so there wasn't exactly much conversation between them and other districts. The Reliquary prided itself on being the one thing standing between the Pariah and complete domination of Erikson. They did prevent chaos, but Theo was skeptical whether domination was really in their purview. Theo smirked. "The northern end of City Government Territory, directly south of here." 

"Good, good. Always nice to see a face from the CGT." She took a few seconds to scribble something down on a pad of paper. "Moving on to the more interesting questions! Why did you apply here?"

In all honesty, he wasn't entirely sure. Of course Felix had wanted them to apply together, and it would give them a way to fight back against the Pariah, but that was astoundingly little motivation when he actually thought about it. He thought of the Reliquary as a group of glorified police officers with way less restriction. They spouted all this nonsense like how they would "keep the people safe" while "preventing conflict" through hunting down anyone they thought might be a threat. To be fair, they did happen to be extremely effective at preventing conflict, and this certainly wasn't some dystopian society where the Reliquary ruled over everyone else. He supposed he wanted to help the people in the less fortunate districts of Erikson, but he wasn't entirely sure this was the way to go about doing that. Of course if he wanted the job, he couldn't tell the woman any of that. 

"I think that the Reliquary does great work for this city and this country, and I'm inspired by you all every day."

Her smile widened at that. She began to put her papers down, just to scramble to pick them back up again, "I almost forgot! Final question, I promise. Do you know what a Relic is?"

"Of course I do, they teach you about them way back in elementary school," Theo responded, almost taken aback by the question, "The name of this organization is the Reliquary, Relics aren't exactly a secret."

"Perfect. In that case, you're going to use one." At that, the mail slot rattled.

Theo was skeptical, at best. Relics were strictly advised against using by everyone including the Reliquary, not to mention how rare they had become. He moved into the middle of the room, leaning on the chair. "Aren't they dangerous?"

In response, she only knocked on the glass separating the two of them with one hand, pointing down towards the slot with the other. Curiosity tugged at Theo, leading him to open the slot and look inside. Inside, he found a regular old black and white die, the type you would find with any board game. He frowned. "That's it?"

No response that time. Everything he had heard about Relics before led him to believe they would be more like relics, ancient even. The type of thing a movie star would find at the end of a two hour long treasure hunt. It couldn't possibly be a real Relic. He went to touch it, hesitated, and then snatched it up anyway.

"So, what do you feel?" the woman asked, reentering the conversation.

Theo backed up from the slot, tossing it from hand to hand. "Exactly the same as usual."

She scribbled something down on her paper and sighed. "You can go now."

"Wait, this isn't even a real Relic though! I'm not supposed to feel anything!"

"Theo, when I said you could leave," she said, her voice growing more stern, "It was an order, not a suggestion."

He could feel his frustration building. Without a doubt, he knew the die wasn't a Relic. The audacity that woman must have to lie about the die, and then tell him to leave when it didn't do anything. Her cheery expression was gone. "Mr. Hargreaves, leave!"

She began to stomp her way out of the observation area. Theo slid the die into his pocket and moved out of the room to meet the woman at the bottom of the stairs.

Huffing down the stairs, she pointed from Theo, to the door, and back again. Only serving to frustrate Theo more, he stormed out of the room, through the one hallway and down the two flights of stairs back to the waiting room. It was noticeably louder there than it was before, but there wasn't time to focus on that. He found Felix leaning against the wall at the back end of the room, passing his hand through his slick black hair.

"Hey Theo! I passed my test, man, I'm gonna start working here soon. Those Relic things are so much-"

"Felix, it's time to go."

Felix grabbed his belongings and jogged to catch up to Theo, who was already hurrying out. "Fine by me. They said they might even make me front line against the Pariah."

Theo kept walking. It was even more aggravating that Felix could seemingly use the Relic they gave him when Theo didn't even get a working one. On top of that, he was turned down where Felix wasn't.

"Oh man, those Relics. You have to tell me what yours did. Theo?" 
He just had to rub it in. Theo scowled. "Can we just wait a bit until we talk about this?"

Felix nodded. Walking outside, Theo was eternally grateful to be back out in the open air again. The sights, sounds, and smells of the Reliquary district stood in stark contrast with each other. Where everything looked clean, as if the roads and walls were power washed daily, the district smelled of smoke and sounded of commotion. At least some other areas were more honest than others with how they looked. Looking south towards Pariah territory, he turned over the die in his pocket.
