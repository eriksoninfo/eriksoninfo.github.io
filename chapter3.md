### Chapter 3

There was no fine line, wall, or border between the CGT and Pariah Territory. Instead, the atmosphere shifted near instantly from developed to developing. The bright colors of the CGT quickly turned to browns, greys, and a heavy helping of rust. Only owning a bike and valuing it too much to risk losing it, Theo had decided to take one of the commerce trains there. Lines ran over most of the city with the primary task of importing and exporting goods. Oftentimes there would be open spots on the trains, and space would be opened up to civilians. Tickets were cheap as it was relatively infrequent for people to transfer away from their home unless they had a very good reason to do so. From what Theo had learned in class, the Pariah shipped out primarily food and products from mining. They had perfected the art of farming underground, creating layers upon layers of crops underneath the city.
	
A siren blared, signaling that it was time for the passengers to get off. The train would only slow, not stop. Brakes squealed, Theo snatched his bag up off the ground, and ran to a large opening in the side of the traincar. He spotted a clearing coming up ahead at a railroad crossing and chose to jump there.

---------------------------------------

It was almost as if the Wild West were transported to present day. Buildings sat squat upon the ground as if they were hugging the Earth. Sidewalks melded with what would be the roads if there were any cars around. 10 minutes since he jumped and Theo had yet to see a single car or motorcycle, but plenty of people wandered the streets. There were some talking amongst each other, some sitting on street corners, and others merely entertaining themselves. Others looked like they were peddling wares. The dirt covered salesmen bounded across the street with oversized backpacks that towered over even their own heads. *Maybe if I packed just a bit more I could have joined them,* Theo thought to himself. As soon as the thought passed through his mind a weathered old woman tripped, causing the contents of her pack to spill out across the ground. *On second thought, not my crowd.*

It was only once Theo had arrived there that he realized he didn’t necessarily have a plan. Or a place to sleep that night. If the train had been on time, then he would have arrived just after 4. That allowed for around 3 or so hours of exploration before he had to figure out a place to sleep or a way to get back home fast.
	
He considered asking around about Relics but figured he looked conspicuous enough already. Those known as the Retainers walked the streets at all times, ‘managing’ people they believed would sour the land. This referred to any and all visitors. A few months back a girl from Theo’s class by the name of Bethany disappeared without notice. Word was that she had ran away from home seeking safety in a place away from less than friendly parents. When an emotionally distraught Bethany made it to this land of savages, she was supposedly found by the Retainers and promptly handled. That was at least the rumor, but it served well to remind him to blend in as best as possible.

Walking around or finding some gathering place was his best bet at gathering intel on the area before he investigated any deeper. A board rested on its side against a building labeled ‘Burial Buffet: *You’ll eat so much we’ll have to bury ya!*’. It was filled with flyers listing various news and opportunities:

**BURIAL BUFFET BUTCHER NEEDED - 1 HOUR = 6$**

*New to Pariah? Watch out for Retainers!*

*See newcomers? Contact the Retainers!*

Theo grinned at seeing those two signs directly next to each other.

*Mallory Farms hiring - Fieldwork Experience and Comfortability in Claustrophobic Spaces Required*

*Bounty($100) - Dick Arbery - On account of giving Pariah secrets to Reliq.*

Wouldn’t be terrible to come into a little bit of quick cash if he ran into this Mr. Arbery.

**RECRUITING PARIAN SOLDIERS - RELICS PROVIDED - 447 MUDRED ST**

Well that just seemed convenient. Theo could pop in, learn how to use that damn dice, and return to the Reliquary with information on the rebels. Easy wins all around. He ripped down the flyer and made his way to his new destination.

---------------------------------------

Shabby. Rundown. It had taken a full two hours to get to the street, not to mention trying to find the building once he got there. Buildings and houses were numbered out of order and addresses were oftentimes scattered on the ground collecting dust. 447 Mudred Street was a small ranch home with only a curtain to be used as an entrance. Above the curtain was a tilted sign welcoming applicants. It was only now, hours and miles into this endeavor, that Theo considered that this may not have been his brightest idea. And yet, without pause, he walked into 447 Mudred Street.
	
The curtain was pulled back, revealing a man who appeared to be in his early forties. He sat at a wooden table, playing some card game by himself while flies buzzed around his head. The man smacked the table with his right hand. Cards flew into the air and his long white hair swayed in front of his battered face. Behind him stood two women, one considerably taller than the other. Where the tall blonde looked upright and confident, the bronze skinned girl with curly dark hair looked less so. Her khaki pants transitioned smoothly into the top of an army uniform that seemed just a little too big for her. On the right side of the chest was the word ‘AMBER’ stitched in red. On second glance, Theo thought that she might be as tall as the blonde if she stopped hunkering over for just a moment.
	
Theo cleared his throat. “Excuse me sir.” At that, the smaller girl rolled her eyes and snatched up a phone from the table. “I’m here to… Can I apply to be a rebel here?”
	
“Ah, of course!” the man said in a much more jovial voice than any outsider could have expected, “We’ll always take new members! Come, come, have a seat.”
	
Without any hint of outside help, a chair from underneath the table whipped around to behind Theo and dashed back to the table, forcing him to sit opposite the man. Odd, but no one else there seemed to mind so it would probably be best if he didn’t either.
	
“Before we get started and I’m initiated into this wonderful movement of yours, I know you guys are huge fans of Relics,” Theo mused, “Mind filling me in a bit on those?”
	
The tiny one left the room with the phone to her ear. The blonde girl sneered and followed right behind. Those were the types of personalities Theo had expected when he came here, not what this older gentleman had been acting like.
	
The cards flew together into one almost perfect stack on the table. “My, my, Mr. Hargreaves, I wasn’t expecting such a fun question this late in the day! Any particular aspect you would like to know more about?” He wagged a wrinkled little finger at Theo. “Remember I’m only telling you this in exchange for your help.”
	
Theo pretended to think for a moment, squeezing the dice in his pocket. “So, if I happened to have one, how would I go about using it?”
	
“You are not a very subtle boy Mr. Hargreaves! Do you know what strand of Relic you may or may not be in possession of?”
	
“Strand?”
	
“Oh my! You really do know very little!” he bellowed. “Come here boy, show me what you have.”
	
Once again the chair whipped Theo around, this time to sit closer to the man. Reluctantly, Theo grabbed out the dice and held it flat on his palm in the direction of the man. He snatched not the dice, but the hand that held it. “Manipulation,” he crooned, “Most assuredly not your specialty.”
	
“I still don’t know how to use it.” Theo sighed, “Got anything to help with that?”
	
“Ah! Education these days, they leave out the good stuff. Somewhere in that teensy tiny little chest of yours,” he poked Theo right in the sternum, “there’s a little bit of energy washing around. There are different names for it; the Waves, the Gears, the Machinations, or as we call it, the Flow. Every person you have ever met has some type of flow inside of them, some ocean beating inside them. These Relics that you see? They have a similar flow inside of them, said to be bestowed upon them by the Earth itself.”
	
Theo was growing impatient and restless. He found himself focusing on the ceiling more than the man’s words.
	
“-tap into that flow, connect to the Relic, and make sure not to stir up too much conflict,” he finished off, laughing as if he had made some joke. Honestly, he might have and Theo was just too zoned out to notice.
	
Finally Theo had been presented with an opportunity to speak. “Last thing, how will I know when it’s working? How can I *use* it?”
	
“Your Manipulation is very subtle, Mr. Hargreaves. If you truly wish it so, I may expedite the process and tell you what you are able to do with this die.”
	
“For the love of Pariah, please skip to that point.”
	
“It may stunt your ability to grow in relation with Relics in the future, and we prefer that not happen to our fighters, Mr. Hargreaves.”
	
“I won’t join you unless you tell me.”
	
The old man sighed, and Theo’s chair slid back to its original place at the table opposite him. “I suppose it wouldn’t hurt too much to know. Yours is a hard one to control, though I can sense you’ve used it on accident once before. Slight emotional control. Where you’re at right now, the people around you feel the same emotions you do when you’re frustrated or ecstatic, the two ends of the emotional scale.”
	
Theo thought back to when he might have used it before. It clicked. Applying at the Reliquary. He got frustrated when he believed the Relic wasn’t working, and the interviewer, in her newfound frustrated state, shooed him away. Huh. No more reason to stay here he supposed. With the way timing had worked, he could probably make it back to a train by sundown, and be back in bed before midnight. The next day, he would show up at the Reliquary, newfound mastery over his power, and info on the location of a rebel recruitment center. He stood up to leave and began to walk towards the curtain.
	
“Mr. Hargreaves, will you not stay and learn more about how you can help us fight back against the Reliquary?”
	
“I need to get some rest for the time being, but I can give you my phone number if you want.” At that the man eagerly nodded. “800-352-4477. I’ll be seeing you later.”
	
He was only steps out the door before he heard the crunch of metal against his right knee. He keeled over in pain, lying on his side upon the street. Looking up, he saw two dark figures with the telltale markings of Retainers. Rusted metal suits with a small red lapel adorning the right shoulder. As he laid there on the ground and a metal boot approached his stomach, he had only one curious thought. He had never told the old man his last name was Hargreaves.
